        Design a comment list component that automatically appends new messages as they arrive. Allow the user to choose
        whether or not to automatically “follow” as new messages arrive.
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom variant="body2">
        <strong>what does follow mean?</strong> Messages should always be appended to the UI as they arrive. When the
        user is following, the UI should ensure that the newest message is always in the viewport. When the user is not
        following, the messages should append into the UI, but avoid automatically scrolling the viewport, to allow a
        user to read without interruption.
